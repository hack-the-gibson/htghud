htghud

## Background

This HUD is based on yahud by whayay, available here: https://github.com/whayay/yahud

It has been heavily modified with regard to colors, menu layout, icon display and scoreboard layout.

## Installing the HUD

**Download**

To download the HUD press the "Download ZIP" button on the right of the github page.

**Installing**

Navigate to ... / Steam / steamapps / common / team fortress 2 / tf / custom / .
Move the "htghud-master" folder into that directory.

## Notes

This HUD does not have a "minimal HUD" mode. Enabling or disabling it will have no effect. I believe that the HUD should be designed to not require a toggle between different displays.
